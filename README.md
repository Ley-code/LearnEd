# LearnEd - AI-Driven School Management System

**Empowering Teachers and Students with Smart Tools**

## Problem Statement
Teachers often spend a lot of time managing grade reports and handling administrative tasks, leaving less time for effective teaching. Similarly, students struggle to reach their full potential due to the lack of tools that help summarize and condense academic material for easier understanding and study.

## Our Solution
**LearnEd** offers an innovative platform that streamlines classroom management for teachers and enhances students' learning experiences through AI-powered tools. 

With LearnEd, both students and teachers can create and join multiple classrooms and study groups, each functioning independently. Teachers can manage grades with ease, while students benefit from AI-generated content, including summaries, flashcards, and quizzes derived from posted academic material.

## Key Features
- **AI-Based Content Processing**: Automatically generate summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from posted materials to help students better prepare for exams.
- **Study Groups**: Students can join study groups where they can collaborate and use AI-driven features to maximize learning.
- **Dynamic Grading System**: A simplified, intuitive grading system that allows teachers to manage assessments efficiently and provides insights into student performance.

## What We Do Better
- **Enhanced Student Learning**: By providing AI-powered tools that summarize and generate practice material, we enable students to better understand and practice academic content.
- **Reduced Teacher Workload**: LearnEd minimizes the administrative burden on teachers by centralizing grading, material sharing, and announcements, allowing for more effective communication with students.

## How It Works
1. **Create and Manage Classrooms**: Teachers can create multiple classrooms, assign students, and manage course materials.
2. **Post Material for AI Processing**: Both teachers and students can upload documents that will be automatically summarized, converted into flashcards, and quizzes for better learning.
3. **Grading System**: Teachers can use the built-in grading system to add, update, and manage student grades seamlessly.
